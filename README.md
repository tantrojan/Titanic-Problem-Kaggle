# Titanic Problem

In this challenge from Kaggle, participants were asked to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, participants were asked to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
# Approach to Solving the Problem
  - Reading the Datasets Provided
  - Bringing out important features by **Visualizing the Data**
  - **Cleaning** the dataset
  - **Normalizing** the dataset and creating features
  - **Fitting** the features into the Classifier
  - **Predicting** the results using the Trained Classifier

## Data Pre-processing 
The dataset provided needs to be cleaned and normalized in order to feed them into the classifier.
  - **Age** is mapped into **Age-Groups**
  ```sh
df["age_groups"]=pd.cut(df["Age"],5)
df.loc[ df['Age'] <= 16, 'Age'] = 0
df.loc[(df['Age'] > 16) & (df['Age'] <= 32), 'Age'] = 1
df.loc[(df['Age'] > 32) & (df['Age'] <= 48), 'Age'] = 2
df.loc[(df['Age'] > 48) & (df['Age'] <= 64), 'Age'] = 3
df.loc[ df['Age'] > 64, 'Age'] = 4
  ```
  - **Gender** is mapped as { 'male' : 1 , 'female' : 0 }
  ```sh
df['Gender']=list(map(lambda x: int(x=='male'),np.array(df['Sex'])))
  ```
  - **Fare** is mapped into **Fare-Groups**
```sh
df["fare_groups"]=pd.qcut(df["Fare"],5)
df.loc[df['Fare']<= 8,"Fare"]=0
df.loc[(df['Fare']>8) & (df['Fare']<=11),"Fare"]=1
df.loc[(df['Fare']>11) & (df['Fare']<=22),"Fare"]=2
df.loc[(df['Fare']>22) & (df['Fare']<=40),"Fare"]=3
df.loc[(df['Fare']>40) & (df['Fare']<=513),"Fare"]=4
```
  - **Embarkment** is mapped as { 'S' : 0 , 'Q' : 1 , 'C' : 2 }
```sh
Embarks={'S':0 ,'C':1 ,'Q':2 ,'0':0}
df['Embarked']=[ Embarks[str(i)] for i in df['Embarked'] ]
```
## Classification
Feeding the Featureset into a classification model to train the Classifier
```sh
from sklearn import < Classifier Class >
...
clf = < Classifier Class >.< Classifier Name >(< Parameters >)
clf.fit(< Features >,< Label >)
Prediction = clf.predict(< Test Features >)
```
#### Types of Classifier used :-
- Logistic Regression
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Classifier
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
